Run & Save (HTI)

--- TESTED ON NEXUS 4 ---

This an android application for joggers with GPS tracking.
It allows the user to keep each Ride he has done and the Route associated to this Ride.

I have developed this application in order to learn about Android programming. 
I am working on it mostly every night during 2 or 3 hours since early october 2013.

This is an alpha version working only with internet (all the data are store in a MongoDB Database).
Here the list of functionalities tested :

  - Login 
  - Register
  - Start running
  - Stop running
  - Update your weight in order to compute calories burnt
  - Display all the user rides in a list with details (calories burnt, duration)
  - Display the route on a Google map (Start & Stop spot)
  
Here the list of functionalities not yet implemented :

  - Compute charts in order to compare different rides with the same route
  - Make an offline option : all the data of the user will be store on his phone in JSON files
  - Possibility of switching between offline & online 


If you don't wanna run you can use my account :
